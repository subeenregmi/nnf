00:42 31-Jul-23: my loss what declining but not going down, it stopped after a limit, 
i think this was the case, as i didnt add a nonlinear function (sigmoid) onto the hidden
layer, thus its just a linear combination of the input layer, thus the network could be 
simplified to just two input nodes and one sigmoidal output node, and that cant work for 
xor, i need to change this and try to figure out why the loss is going down.
